In C++, you must specify the return type, whereas JavaScript and Python allow more flexibility due to their dynamic nature.

Contiguous Storage	             Yes	                          No                              	No
Access via Address	  Possible using &array[index]	        Not accessible	                Not directly accessible (use id())
Dynamic Resizing	             No	                             Yes                               	Yes
Address Calculation	Based on data type size (4 bytes for int)	Abstracted	                Abstracted


C++ allows direct memory manipulation and address calculation, making it suitable for low-level programming.
JavaScript and Python abstract memory management, focusing on flexibility and ease of use.

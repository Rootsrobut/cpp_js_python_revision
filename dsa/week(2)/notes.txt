use # private fields/methods for true privacy, and follow naming conventions like _ for protected members.in js



### Explanation:
1. **Class Definition**: The `Student` class is defined with a private field `#age` to mimic the private member in C++.
2. **Constructor**: The constructor handles different initialization scenarios similar to the C++ constructors.

The `__init__` method serves as the constructor, and the `__del__` method serves as the destructor.
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to execute the code when the script is run directly.
In Python, the attributes __numerator and __denominator are private.
In JavaScript, the # syntax is used to define private fields.

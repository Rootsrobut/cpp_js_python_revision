Substring Operations:
In both JavaScript and substring or slicing can extract parts of a string.
In Python, slicing uses [start:end], while JavaScript uses substring(start, end).
String Comparison:
Use === in JavaScript for strict equality.
Use == in Python for string equality.



In both JavaScript and Python, Set is used to store unique values.
In Python, set() is a built-in type, while JavaScript has a Set class.
In both languages, adding elements to a set automatically removes duplicates.
JavaScript uses a for...of loop for iterating over a Set.
Python uses a for loop for iterating over a set.
Use s.has(value) in JavaScript.
Use value in s in Python.



Map/Dictionaries:

JavaScript uses a Map object for key-value pairs, while Python uses a dict.
Use m.get(key, 0) in Python and (m.get(key) || 0) in JavaScript to handle missing keys when counting.
In JavaScript, use a for...of loop with destructuring ([key, value]) to iterate over a Map.
In Python, use for key, value in m.items() for dictionary iteration.

Use m.delete(key) in JavaScript and del m[key] in Python.




Priority Queues:

Python uses heapq, which by default is a min-heap.
JavaScript requires implementing custom priority queues since it doesn't have built-in support.
Lists:
Python uses deque for efficient appending/popping from both ends.
JavaScript relies on array methods like push, unshift, pop, and shift.

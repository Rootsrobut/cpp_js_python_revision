Aspect	                                         Copy Constructor	                                                     Assignment Operator

Purpose	                           Creates a new object by copying another object.	          Copies the contents from one object to another existing object.

When Called	                             Called during object initialization.	                        Called during assignment after initialization.

Default Behavior	                    Provided by the compiler if not defined.	                      Provided by the compiler if not defined.

Object State	                         Works on an uninitialized object.	                               Works on an already initialized object.

Example Usage	                        MyClass obj2(obj1); MyClass obj2 = obj1;                                       obj2 = obj1;


struct: In C++, members of a struct are public by default, and it is typically used for plain data structures.
class: In C++, members of a class are private by default, and it is generally used for defining objects with encapsulation, methods, and access control.






In struct inheritance, the default access specifier for base class members is public.
In class inheritance, the default access specifier for base class members is private.






Destructor:

JavaScript uses garbage collection, so we use a destroy() method to manually nullify resources.
Python has __del__ for destructor functionality.


Shallow and Deep Copy:
In JavaScript, shallow and deep copy logic is handled through explicit methods


In Python, similar custom methods mimic the behavior.

sizeof Alternative:
JavaScript uses length for arrays.
Python uses len() for lists.

const members function in 
Python and JavaScript do not have a direct equivalent for const objects or member functions.

The simplify() method uses the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), implemented using recursion in JavaScript and the math.gcd() function in Python.
